# Intents Overview
This section provides a comprehensive list of all available intents within the platform. Each intent serves as a unique identifier for a specific action that users can initiate. The platform uses these intents to interpret user requests and trigger the corresponding actions.

For each intent, you will find an example that includes the relevant HawkWing configuration and the associated API request. The `/api` folder contains the [Kreya API Files](https://kreya.app/) it can be simpliy imported.
 Each example has been tested in the provided test network environment, offering you a practical reference for implementing these intents in your own configurations.
